# Schumann - Estrella: Finale 2014
## V.1
## Impressions


----------
As for Finale 2014, this particular example seems well suited:

 1. There are clear cut voices
 2. Repetitions are consistent and clear
 3. Title, text, enhancements are rather clear

This all seems typical of a middle-romantic work.

My approach is simple: make good use of the simple not entry (via computer keyboard) and shortcuts, going through it and using all the shortcuts to my disposal.

## Music Entry


----------
### Right Hand
As far as music entry is concerned, I used the default document wizard and entered raw information as far as Title, Header information, and the like. I began with entering the _upper clef_.

Time Lapsed: 10:00 min.

What became difficult was the "intuition" of the simple entry method was how backwards I had to change my thinking to really get the "hang" of it. everytime I typed a note, I had to remember to add the following (in order):

 - Note
 - accidental
 - augmentation (if any)
 - ottovation (if any)
 - tie (if any).
If I got out of the wrong order, I basically had to click and drag edits, or restart the note (which is what I was trying to do in order to "get the hang of it.").

In fact, what I had to do was go back and add the ties from the middle of the page and following. That absorbed a lot of time. 

A few things I noticed that would significantly enhance this entry, but that I don't have, are a mouse and perhaps a MIDI keyboard. I am, however, stuck as of the moment.

There are no articulations or other phrasing edits added yet at this point.
### Left Hand
Same methodology; input each voice one at a time.

Time Lapsed: 10:00 min.

 Intuitive properties were difficult as before.
 
 The default properties and placement of notes are extremely annoying (though I am happy that the default output gets the ties and rhythmic displacement relatively well.
 
## Known Issues
 


----------
Of course, Finale does not get the default re-typesetting of cautionary accidentals. I am aware that these things are missing. If all is good, and there are no further comments, I will work on adding phrasing slurs and articulations.
